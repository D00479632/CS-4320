I have selected a project idea (see the Project_Idea.pdf)

It's time for initial data exploration and analysis.

# Requirements

- Load data
- Explore data
- Prepare data (if necessary)
- Report on data analysis

## Load data

You must load the data into your project. This means write and test the code that makes the data available to your program.

### Explore data

Understand your data. We're looking for some of the printouts and plots that we have done throughout the semester. You're looking for data types, data trends, missing data, data relationships, etc. Image data and tabular data have different kinds of exploration. Do what is appropriate for your data set.

## Prepare data

Some data is cleanly packaged and others need to be cleaned up. Write and test the code that will turn your data into the features(X) and labels(y). If the data needs some pre-processing such as one-hot-encoding, normalization, or imputing missing data, do that. Split the data into train, validation, and test sets.

## Report on data analysis

Write and submit a report on your data.

Start with a very brief description of your project. (1-2 sentences)

Describe the type, distributions, and interesting relationships of primary data, both features and labels. These descriptions may be easily adapted from your data exploration tables and plots.

Describe the preprocessing steps and any data cleaning steps that you applied to your data. A simple bullet point list is a good format for this.

Describe the final shapes of the data sets after preprocessing. Report the sizes of the train, validation, and test sets.

End with a conclusion about the feasibility of learning from this data set.
